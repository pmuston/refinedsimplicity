Wow! the Gatsby Tutorial was quite a rollercoaster ride!

Background: Coming from being very comfortable with VueJS and APIs. BUT, having just create a few sites in double quick time using Hugo I am really impressed with this JAMstack idea. Thinking I could double down by learning Gatsby.

Diving in... https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/
I was quite liking it before section 4 ...ok so this JSX thing works quite nicely
for creating computed HTML, ...and CSS and Typography. I'm getting it.

Section 4 (on data)... SAY WHAT! You have to do how much boilerplate just to get
the site meta data into a page? And the same again to get it onto a different page.

Pushing through to section 5, 6 & 7... ok so I see this is a unified data system ...liking that idea.
Seems a bit like I have hammer, so everything is a nail.
But ok I get it - if I develop ninja hammer techniques I'm set.

Section 8 (deploy) ...I can improve the Lighthouse score ...Let's look at the page
source. SAY WHAT! What is all this? Looking further looking into public directory,
no nice html pages like Hugo creates... A whole heap of js files.
This isn't a static site generator - at least not a static pages generator.
It is more a statical served single page app generator.
I was mis-sold... Calming down...Actually
I can see use cases where this would be an advantage.
It is pushing more capability out to the edge.
A big win for sites with massive traffic?

Questions - I am sure there are answer but they are open for me:

* am I losing the search-ability of static pages?
* how do I protect routes for certain roles?
* for low volume startup sites, should I just stick to single page VueJS app
with APIs (maybe GraphQL)? OR Is this just familiarity bias.

Ho hum....
